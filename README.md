# CIFAR-10_Image_Classification (CS776 Computer Vision Assignment)

This project focuses on implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying CIFAR-10 images. The process involves various steps such as data preprocessing, image transformations, creating an augmented training set, feature extraction, implementing the MLP model, training it using backpropagation, and evaluating its performance.


## Dataset

Download the CIFAR-10 dataset and add it in data folder.

## How to Run
To run the code run code form the jupyter notebook.
